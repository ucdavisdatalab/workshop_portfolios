It is a tool that you can use in addition to your CV or resume to demonstrate your skills to potential collaborators or employers. Typically, these take the form of a website that is styled specifically to highlight the kind of skills you want to showcase. You might think of your portfolio as public evidence of your data science skills. For example, your portfolio might features your code (including documentation) and writing samples to show your ability to communicate effectively about data. You might use the text to illustrate how you approach problem-solving. 2.3 Approach In this workshop, we will approach creating a digital data science portfolio through a series of steps. This is just one possible workflow. You might find that starting on a different step is more helpful for you, and that’s ok. You can think of today’s process as a checklist of things to do and consider, but they don’t necessarily need to happen in this order. Our suggested workflow is: Set your goals for your portfolio. Decide on a few project to include. (You can expand later.) Decide on a platform for your portfolio. Build a draft. Get and implement feedback. Share. 2.4 Things to Consider This will probably expand into different sections 2.4.1 Plan your Portfolio What is your goal? What story to you want to tell? What impression/feeling/etc. do you want to inspire in the people viewing your portfolio? Which skills and projects do you want to highlight? Which skills and projects help you tell your story to the viewer? Links to public repositories like GitHub "],["setting-your-goals.html", "3 Setting Your Goals", " 3 Setting Your Goals What is the purpose of your portfolio? What jobs are you applying to? What skills do you want to highlight? Have you done an “informational interview” and looked at portfolios in your domain? What technologies are comfortable with already? This is a great excuse to learn new skills! How will you maintain it? How often will you be updating it? ACTIVITY 1 (Introspective; paste it into the chat): write down 3-5 personal “goals” 1-2 examples? Like: I can use R to clean data, write a model, and plot results.

If it’s a mapping project, an image of the map is an obvious choice. If it’s code, think about an image that helps tell the story. Maybe its a visualization (graph or diagram) from the analysis? Maybe it’s a workflow diagram you drew? 4.0.1 Gather Contact Information: There are many things you could include. Choose how you want to engage with others. Some options include: Name Email ORCid or other identifiers Links to public profiles, like your GitHub profile, Google Scholar, Linkedin, or other quasi-social media for work Work-related social media account "],["platforms.html", "5 Platforms 5.1 Platform Considerations 5.2 Platform Types 5.3 Examples", " 5 Platforms There are many platforms available to serve as a home for your digital portfolio. But which platform should you use? Let’s take a look at some of the categories and options. Please note that new tools become available quite frequently, so this list is not intended to be comprehensive. 5.1 Platform Considerations First, there are some things to consider. The platform you chose can serve as another way to highlight a skill you have or an opportunity to develop a skill you want to gain, for example, HTML, Shiny, Wordpress, or GitHub Pages. Style considerations: does your platform have themes that you can use to your advantage? For example, WordPress has some free templates that are specifically geared towards portfolios. If you plan to use images, does the platform represent images in an engaging way? 5.2 Platform Types 5.2.1 Website Builders Website Builders are online tools that help you build a website. They typically allow for easy integration of pre-built styles (and changing between styles) and have some kind of content management system to help you keep track of pages and posts. They also usually include a free service tier and can make buying and using a custom domain (website URL) straight forward at minimal yearly cost. Website builders are good for both novices and pros. Just because you can write HTML and CSS doesn’t mean you want to do this on every project. For beginners, this option makes a professional-looking website quickly without a lot of hassle. Be sure to explore the theme options for your builder of choice. Some themes are free, but others may have a fee to use. Often, you’ll find themes that are specifically built for portfolios, but blog themes may also do the job well. Website Builders include: * Wix * Wordpress * Weebly 5.2.1.1 Pros&amp; Cons: Pros: * Graphical user interface, no coding * Content manager * Pre-built styles, and easy to change styles * Multiple pages are possible * Looks professional quickly Cons: * Customizing can be complicated 5.2.2 Build Your Own Website If you want to demonstrate or develop your skills in web development, you should consider building your own website. To make you own website, you’ll need the following: 5.2.2.1 Content You can handle content in a couple of ways: hand-coded - edit HTML + CSS (and probably javascript) directly static generator - edit HTML or Markdown directly - Jekyll, Sphinx content manager - write content in a graphical user interface pre-built - ionos, dreamhost (log-in and pick the software you want them to run for you) build-your-own - using AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets 5.2.2.2 Hosting Services static hosting server - github pages dynamic hosting service - AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets 5.2.2.3 Domain (optional) A domain is the base URL for your collection of webpages. And example of a domain is ucdavis.edu You can purchase a custom domain to make your website more memorable. Many hosting service offer domain purchasing and registration as an add-on service. 5.2.2.4 Pros&amp; Cons: Pros: * Control over every aspect of the site * Demonstrate your web skills effectively Cons: * You are responsible for security and accessibility updates 5.2.3 Minimal Effort These options are a good start, but you probably want to develop a more creative portfolio that expresses your work in an engaging way. LinkedIn Profile Your LinkedIn Profile can serve as a portfolio of sorts, especially if you use the “Featured” section to link to projects you want to highlight. This is a good start, but doesn’t have the same impact as a well thought out, personal portfolio. Do both, and then add the link for your portfolio to the “Featured” section of your LinkedIn profile. GitHub Profile Repository Another fairly minimal option for producing a bare-bones profile is to create a GitHub repository with a README file that links to your other repositories with some text for context. This is another nice way to get started, but it might leave an underwhelming impression on potential employers. 5.2.3.1 Pros&amp; Cons: Pros: * Can be used in conjunction with a full portfolio * A good starting point to building out a full portfolio Cons: * Might be construed as lazy if a full portfolio is called for * Less impact than a full portfolio 5.3 Examples Research Data Scientist Ryan Peek Arthur?
