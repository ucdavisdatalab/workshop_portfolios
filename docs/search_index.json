For example, WordPress has some free templates that are specifically geared towards portfolios. How can you visually represent the work your are highlighting? If it’s a mapping project, an image of the map is an obvious choice. If it’s code, think about an image that helps tell the story. Maybe its a visualization (graph or diagram) from the analysis? Maybe it’s a workflow diagram you drew? Links to public repositories like GitHub 2.3.2 Gather Contact Information: There are many things you could include. Choose how you want to engage with others.
