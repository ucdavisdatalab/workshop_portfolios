Make a list of any skills you would like to develop or improve. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Introducing Digital Portfolios 2.2 Approach", " 2 Introduction 2.1 Introducing Digital Portfolios A digital portfolio is an electronic collection of examples of your work. It is a tool that you can use in addition to your CV or resume to demonstrate your skills to potential collaborators or employers. Typically, these take the form of a website that is styled specifically to highlight the kind of skills you want to showcase. You might think of your portfolio as public evidence of your data science skills. For example, your portfolio might feature your code (including documentation) and writing samples to show your ability to communicate effectively about data. You might use the text to illustrate how you approach problem-solving. 2.2 Approach In this workshop, we will approach creating a digital data science portfolio through a series of steps. This is just one possible workflow. You might find that starting on a different step is more helpful for you, and that’s ok. You can think of today’s process as a checklist of things to do and consider, but they don’t necessarily need to happen in this order. Our suggested workflow is: Set your goals for your portfolio Decide on a few project to include (you can expand later) Decide on a platform for your portfolio Build a draft Get and implement feedback Share In this workshop, we’ll focus on the first three steps. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a solid plan for how to build your portfolio which you can then implement when you have more focused time to work. "],["setting-your-goals.html", "3 Setting Your Goals", " 3 Setting Your Goals Every portfolio should have a goal or a purpose. What should the viewer learn about you and your work? What do you want to demonstrate? A portfolio isn’t a CV. It shouldn’t be a catalog of everything you have ever done, but rather, it should be a collection of your best work. But most of all, it should communicate something about you to the viewer. Yes, your overall goal for this process is probably to get a job, but that’s not exactly what we mean. A clear goal should be achievable and specific. Below are some examples of achievable, specific goals: Demonstrate my coding skills in Python Illustrate my data visualization skills Showcase my data science ability with respect to my domain (like Biology, Hydrology, or English) Highlight my ability to complete projects Show that I can collaborate with several people Demonstrate my breadth of skills Highlight the kinds of projects I want to work on in the future Demonstrate that I can use R to clean data, write a model, and plot results Expand my collaboration network by demonstrating my skills Here are some questions and tasks that might help you define your goals: After viewing your portfolio, what impression do you want the viewer to have of you and your skills? What is the purpose of your portfolio? What story to you want to tell? What jobs are you applying to? What skills do you want to highlight? What skills do you want to learn? Review some portfolios from people in your domain. What do you think their portfolios communicate? ACTIVITY 1: Write down 1-2 goals for your portfolio. What do you want the viewer to learn about you? Share your goals in the chat. "],["content.html", "4 Content 4.1 Projects 4.2 Contact Information", " 4 Content A good portfolio communicates and demonstrates your skills to the viewer. How you do that is something of a creative endeavor. We’ll discuss some of the sections and information you could include, but what you include is up to you. You should not try to include everything, but rather pick the information that supports your goal. Every portfolio needs a projects and a contact information section, but the rest is up to you. 4.1 Projects The projects section is the heart of your portfolio and should appear in every portfolio. Here, you will provide a curated collection of projects you want to highlight. Project descriptions could be self-contained or they can link out to other websites and code repositories. Consider including visuals here. If the project involves data visualization, such as a graph, workflow diagram, or map, you might choose that image as your visual. If the project was purely code, you could consider a stock image, just be aware of the image’s license and only use images that are open licensed or you have permission to use. The projects you list should support the goal you have for your portfolio. If my goal is to demonstrate my data visualization skills, I could include code that produces a visualization, but I wouldn’t include a script that cleans data and doesn’t produce a visualization. If I feel like that cleaning script is valuable in telling my story, maybe I need to redefine my goals for this portfolio. I might want to consider having sections for different kinds of projects. ACTIVITY 2: Pick 3 projects you want to include in your portfolio. How do each of these support the goals of your portfolio? 4.2 Contact Information This section is also mandatory. You want people to know who you are so they can contact you if they are interested in your work. What information you provide is up to you. How do you decide? Reflect back on your goals. What contact information will help you achieve the goal for your portfolio? Here are some types of contact information to consider: Name - the name you use on job applications Other names you are well-known by (IRC handle, Discord handle) Email Address OCRid Google Scholar (if academic) Other academic profiles (Academia.edu, Kudos, Figshare) GitHub Profile Other tech community profiles (Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Reddit LinkedIn Profile Website Work-related social media accounts that you use to represent yourself professionally (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.) "],["platforms.html", "5 Platforms 5.1 Platform Considerations 5.2 Platform Types 5.3 Examples", " 5 Platforms There are many platforms available to serve as a home for your digital portfolio. But which platform should you use? Let’s take a look at some of the categories and options. Please note that new tools become available quite frequently, so this list is not intended to be comprehensive. 5.1 Platform Considerations First, there are some things to consider. The platform you chose can serve as another way to highlight a skill you have or an opportunity to develop a skill you want to gain, for example, HTML, Shiny, Wordpress, or GitHub Pages. Style considerations: does your platform have themes that you can use to your advantage? For example, WordPress has some free templates that are specifically geared towards portfolios. If you plan to use images, does the platform represent images in an engaging way? How will you maintain it? How often will you be updating it? 5.2 Platform Types 5.2.1 Website Builders Website Builders are online tools that help you build a website. They typically allow for easy integration of pre-built styles (and changing between styles) and have some kind of content management system to help you keep track of pages and posts. They also usually include a free service tier and can make buying and using a custom domain (website URL) straight forward at minimal yearly cost. Website builders are good for both novices and pros. Just because you can write HTML and CSS doesn’t mean you want to do this on every project. For beginners, this option makes a professional-looking website quickly without a lot of hassle. Be sure to explore the theme options for your builder of choice. Some themes are free, but others may have a fee to use. Often, you’ll find themes that are specifically built for portfolios, but blog themes may also do the job well. Website Builders include: Wix Wordpress Weebly 5.2.1.1 Pros&amp; Cons: Pros: Graphical user interface, no coding Content manager Pre-built styles, and easy to change styles Multiple pages are possible Looks professional quickly Cons: * Customizing can be complicated 5.2.2 Build Your Own Website If you want to demonstrate or develop your skills in web development, you should consider building your own website. To make you own website, you’ll need the following: 5.2.2.1 Content You can handle content in a couple of ways: hand-coded - edit HTML + CSS (and probably javascript) directly static generator - edit HTML or Markdown directly - Jekyll, Sphinx content manager - write content in a graphical user interface pre-built - ionos, dreamhost (log-in and pick the software you want them to run for you) build-your-own - using AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets 5.2.2.2 Hosting Services static hosting server - github pages dynamic hosting service - AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets 5.2.2.3 Domain (optional) A domain is the base URL for your collection of webpages. And example of a domain is ucdavis.edu You can purchase a custom domain to make your website more memorable. Many hosting service offer domain purchasing and registration as an add-on service. 5.2.2.4 Pros&amp; Cons: Pros: Control over every aspect of the site Demonstrate your web skills effectively Cons: You are responsible for security and accessibility updates 5.2.3 Minimal Effort These options are a good start, but you probably want to develop a more creative portfolio that expresses your work in an engaging way. LinkedIn Profile Your LinkedIn Profile can serve as a portfolio of sorts, especially if you use the “Featured” section to link to projects you want to highlight. This is a good start, but doesn’t have the same impact as a well thought out, personal portfolio. Do both, and then add the link for your portfolio to the “Featured” section of your LinkedIn profile. GitHub Profile Repository Another fairly minimal option for producing a bare-bones profile is to create a GitHub repository with a README file that links to your other repositories with some text for context. This is another nice way to get started, but it might leave an underwhelming impression on potential employers. 5.2.3.1 Pros&amp; Cons: Pros: Can be used in conjunction with a full portfolio A good starting point to building out a full portfolio Cons: Might be construed as lazy if a full portfolio is called for Less impact than a full portfolio 5.3 Examples Research Data Scientist Ryan Peek Arthur?
