Digital portfolios expand upon the skills in your other application materials for jobs or grants, allowing you to showcase your abilities. In this workshop we will discuss why you should create and maintain a digital portfolio of your work, various methods for creating a digital portfolio, and considerations for carefully curating and presenting your work in an engaging manner. 0.2 Learning Objectives By the end of this workshop learners should be able to: Describe what a digital portfolio contains and how it is useful; Set a clear goal for their portfolio; Describe methods for creating and curating their digital portfolio; Articulate reasons to choose a particular platform to host their portfolio; Identify how and when to get feedback; Develop a plan for sharing their portfolio. 0.3 Prerequisites Participants should have access to a web browser (for example, Chrome or Firefox). See the next section (Prepare) for recommended preparation for this workshop. The icons used to illustrate this reader are from The Noun Project’s Iconathon icon set, public domain icons produced through a series of design workshops aimed at producing civic minded symbols. In particular, we focused on the Redefining Women Icon Set. "],["prepare.html", "1 Prepare", " 1 Prepare In preparation for this workshop, please complete the following tasks: Create or update your CV (Curriculum Vitae). The UC Davis Internship and Career Center has excellent resources to help you get started or improve your CV. In this workshop, you will use your CV as a resource and inspiration for what to include in your digital portfolio. Make a list of all of the skills you have. This should include technical skills (such as programming languages), and can also include interpersonal, communication, and leadership skills. Listing your hobbies is at your discretion, and can be helpful if they interface with your reserach/work (i.e., graphic design and data visualization). Make a list of any skills you would like to develop or improve. We recommend you downloading this worksheet that accompanies this workshop in advance. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Introducing Digital Portfolios 2.2 Approach", " 2 Introduction 2.1 Introducing Digital Portfolios A digital portfolio is an electronic collection of examples of your work. It is a tool that you can use in addition to your CV (or resume) to demonstrate your skills to potential collaborators, employers, and/or funders. Typically, these take the form of a website that is styled specifically to highlight the kind of skills you want to showcase. You can think of your portfolio as public evidence of your data science skills. For example, your portfolio can feature your code (including documentation) and writing samples to show your ability to reproducibly work with data and communicate your findings. You can also use the narrative to illustrate how you develop a research question and/or approach problem-solving. 2.2 Approach We’ll use a series of steps to help you approach creating a digital data science portfolio. This is just one possible workflow. You might find that starting on a different step is more helpful for you, and that’s okay. You can think of this process as a checklist of things to do and consider before making your portfolio public, but they don’t necessarily need to happen in this order. Suggested workflow: Set your goals for your portfolio Decide on a few projects to include (you can expand on this list later) Choose a platform for your portfolio Build a draft Get and implement feedback Share! This workshop focuses on the first three steps (goals, projects, platform). By the end of the workshop you’ll have a solid plan for how to build your portfolio, which you can then implement afterwards. "],["setting-your-goals.html", "3 Setting Your Goals", " 3 Setting Your Goals Every portfolio should have a goal or a purpose. What do you want the viewer to learn about you and your work? What do you need to demonstrate to convince them you have the skills listed on your CV or resume? What skills can the portfolio showcase that you can’t articulate elsewhere? A portfolio is not a CV. It shouldn’t be a catalog of everything you have ever done. Instead it should be a collection of your best work, or the specific work you most want to showcase to your target audience. But most of all, it should communicate something about your work to the viewer. Your portfolio should have a goal. (Your overall goal for this process is probably to get a job, but you’ll need to dig deeper than that!) You portfolio can have multiple goals, and they should all be achievable and specific. Here are some examples: Demonstrate my coding skills in Python Illustrate my data visualization skills with ggplot in R Showcase my data science ability with respect to my domain (i.e., Biology, Hydrology, English, etc.) Highlight my ability to complete projects Show that I can work collaboratively with several people Show that I can take a leadership role on a project Demonstrate the breadth of my technical skills Highlight the kinds of projects I want to work on in the future Demonstrate that I can use R to clean data, write a model, and plot results Showcase my ability to communicate complex research findings Expand my collaboration network by demonstrating my skills Here are some questions and tasks that might help you define your goals: After viewing your portfolio, what impression do you want the viewer to have of you and your skills? What is the purpose of your portfolio? What story to you want to tell? What jobs are you applying to, and what qualities or skills are important in this field? What skills do you want to highlight? What skills do you want to learn? Review some portfolios from people in your domain. What do you think their portfolios communicate? ACTIVITY 1 Write down 1-2 goals for your portfolio. What do you want the viewer to learn about you? REPORT OUT: Share your goals in the chat. "],["content.html", "4 Content 4.1 Projects 4.2 Contact Information 4.3 About 4.4 Skills 4.5 Publications", " 4 Content A good portfolio communicates and demonstrates your skills to the viewer. How you do that is something of a creative endeavor. We’ll discuss potential sections and information you can include, but what you include is up to you and should be informed by your goals and objective. You should not try to include everything, but rather pick the information that supports your goal. Every portfolio needs a Projects and a Contact Information section, but the rest is up to you. 4.1 Projects The projects section is the heart of your portfolio. Here, you will provide a curated collection of projects you want to highlight. Project descriptions can be self-contained, or they can link out to other websites and code repositories. (You don’t have to re-create things that you’ve published elsewhere.) Consider including visuals in this section. If the project involves data visualization, such as a graph or map, you might choose that image as your visual. If the project was purely code, you could consider making a workflow diagram. You can include a stock image from the data provider, technology you used, or something related to the domain of the project - just be aware of the image’s license and only use images that are open licensed or you have permission to use (and don’t forget to include attributions). The projects you list should support the goal you have for your portfolio. For example, if my goal is to demonstrate my data visualization skills, I could include code that produces a visualization, but I wouldn’t include a script that cleans data and doesn’t produce a visualization. If I feel like that cleaning script is valuable in telling my story, maybe I need to redefine and expand my goals for this portfolio. In that case, I might want to consider having sections for different kinds of projects, or sub-sections within a project. IDEA: Consider separating projects into categories based on their type and/or skills used. ACTIVITY 2 Pick 3 projects you want to include in your portfolio. How do each of these support the goals of your portfolio? REPORT OUT: Share one project &amp; how it supports your goal. 4.2 Contact Information This section is also mandatory. You want people to know who you are so they can contact you if they are interested in your work. What information you provide is up to you. How do you decide? Reflect back on your goals. What contact information will help you achieve the goal for your portfolio? Here are some types of contact information to consider: Name - the name you use on your job applications and publications Other names you are well-known by (IRC handle, Discord handle, previous names you’ve published under, etc.) Email Address - whether you use an institutional or personal email address is up to you ORCid Google Scholar (if academic) Other academic profiles (Academia.edu, Kudos, Figshare) GitHub Profile - if you don’t have a github account, now’s a good time to make one! Other tech community profiles (Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Reddit) LinkedIn Profile Website - for your current organization or projet(s) Work-related social media accounts that you use to represent yourself professionally (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.) 4.3 About The about section is the place to describe yourself, your background, and to give your portfolio more context. You might talk about your experience in and out of your current field. To help you write this section, take a look at the cultural norms of your domain, industry, and region. In some fields and countries it’s common to talk about personal things such as your family and hobbies, while in other areas that information is often omitted. 4.4 Skills Just like you might have on your CV, you can have a section where you list your skills. IDEA: Consider organizing your portfolio by this list and linking each skill to that section of your website. Some website tools (particularly with content managers like Wordpress) will allow you to tag posts with keywords and then link to a search for that keyword. 4.5 Publications Add a list of your publications with their DOI (digital object identifier) if available. Ideally, you can also link to the download site for each paper online to facilitate finding those papers. IDEA: Consider linking to your contact info page so people can easily to contact you about your papers. "],["platforms.html", "5 Platforms 5.1 Platform Considerations 5.2 Platform Types", " 5 Platforms A platform is the online tool that will host your digital portfolio and make it available to the public through the internet. There are many platforms available to serve as a home for your digital portfolio, so which platform should you use? Let’s take a look at some of the categories and options. (Please note that new tools become available quite frequently, so this list is not intended to be comprehensive and may need to be updated periodically.) 5.1 Platform Considerations Technical considerations: What platforms are commonly used in your field? Do you have prior experience with a specific platform that you can leverage? The platform you chose can highlight your technical skills - or provide an opportunity to help you develop a skill you want to gain. For example, HTML, Shiny, Wordpress, or GitHub Pages can all be used in creating a digital portfolio. Style considerations: Does your platform have themes that you can use to your advantage? For example, WordPress has some free templates that are specifically geared towards portfolios. There are existing project templates on GitHub that, if they fit your needs, you can fork and modify for your portfolio. If you plan to use images, does the platform represent images in an engaging way? If you’re showcasing dynamic, interactive, and/or video visualizations can the platform handle those? Maintenance considerations: How robust is the platform? How often will you be updating it? Is there an associated cost to hosting your portfolio that you need to be prepared for? 5.2 Platform Types 5.2.1 Website Builders Website Builders are online tools that help you build a website through an online graphical user interface. They typically allow for easy integration of pre-built styles (and changing between styles) and have some kind of content management system to help you keep track of pages and posts. They also usually include a free service tier and can make buying and using a custom domain (website URL) straight forward at minimal yearly cost. Website builders are good for both novices and pros. Just because you can write HTML and CSS doesn’t mean you have to (or want to!) do this for every project. For beginners, this option makes a professional-looking website quickly without a lot of hassle. Be sure to explore the theme options for your builder of choice. Some themes are free, but others may have an associated fee. Often, you’ll find themes that are specifically built for portfolios, but blog themes may also do the job well. Some common Website Builders that may be apprioriate for digital portfolios include: Wix Wordpress Weebly Pros: Cons: Graphical user interface, no coding is necessary Customizing can be complicated Content manager Pre-built styles, and easy to change styles Multiple pages are possible Looks professional quickly 5.2.2 Build Your Own Website If you want to demonstrate or develop your skills in web development, you should consider building your own website. To make you own website, you’ll need the following: Content You can handle content in a couple of ways: Hand-coded: edit HTML + CSS (and probably javascript) directly Static generator: edit HTML or Markdown directly and generate the website with tools like Jekyll or Sphinx Content manager: write content in a graphical user interface with the following options: pre-built: log-in and pick the software you want them to run for you such as ionos, dreamhost, etc. build-your-own: using AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets. etc. Hosting Services Hosting services provide the physical equipment and maintenance to make your website visible on the internet. Options include: Static hosting server: examples include GitHub pages Dynamic hosting service: examples include AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets Domain (optional) A domain is the base URL for your collection of webpages. And example of a domain is ucdavis.edu. You can purchase a custom domain to make your website more memorable, but that is not necessary. Many hosting service offer domain purchasing and registration as an add-on service. Pros: Cons: Control over every aspect of the site You are often responsible for security and accessibility updates Demonstrate your web skills effectively 5.2.3 Short on Time? The options we will discuss in this section are a way to get started in a relatively short period of time, but eventually you probably will want to invest more time to develop a more creative and polished portfolio to best express and showcase your work in an engaging way. LinkedIn Profile Your LinkedIn Profile can serve as a portfolio of sorts, especially if you use the “Featured” section to link to projects you want to highlight. This is a good start, but doesn’t have the same impact as a well thought out personal portfolio. IDEA: Do both, and then add the link for your portfolio to the “Featured” section of your LinkedIn profile. GitHub Profile Repository Another fairly minimal option for producing a bare-bones profile is to create a GitHub repository with a README file that links to your other repositories with some text for context. This is another nice way to get started, but it might leave an underwhelming impression on potential employers. (And if the human resources or hiring manager aren’t familiar with GitHub themselves - as can sometimes be the case - they might not know how to look for the skills you are trying to highlight.) Pros: Cons: Can be used in conjunction with a full portfolio Less impact than a full portfolio A good starting point to building out a full portfolio Might reflect negatively on your skills if a full portfolio is called for "],["examples.html", "6 Examples 6.1 Examples of Data Science Portfolios", " 6 Examples 6.1 Examples of Data Science Portfolios Below are some examples of portfolios of DataLab affiliates and alumni who work in the Data Sciences and related areas. These portfolios are hosted on a variety of different platforms and are organized differently to meet the goals of each individual. Arthur Koehl has excellent visuals and descriptive text using a simple, but highly effective, structure. Michele Tobias has separate portfolio pages for different aspects of her work and other pages to give the work more context. Taylor Reiter has a visually uncomplicated yet impactful website with links to project web pages and her other academic profiles. Ryan Peek combines a blog and dynamic roject examples. Samuel Pizelo has a simple list of projects supported by context on other pages (bio, contact info, teaching, etc.). Liza Wood uses tabs on her Research page to divide her work into categories. Jared Joseph showcases his visualization skills, using the website design to underscore those skills. Hervé Guillon has separate pages for datasets and packages he has developed. Rich Pauloo uses a tile widget to list his projects. Allison Horst showcases her artwork that explains data science concepts on her portfolio. "],["getting-feedback.html", "7 Getting Feedback 7.1 Asking for Feedback 7.2 Using Feedback", " 7 Getting Feedback 7.1 Asking for Feedback After you have implemented your plan and have a solid draft of your digital online portfolio, the next step is to solicit feedback from a few trusted colleagues. Ask for reviews of your portfolio from friends as well as people who know your industry well. Getting feedback at this stage will help you tailor the impression your portfolio makes as well as help you uncover mistakes or misunderstandings before you release your portfolio to a wider audience. Define for your reviewers the areas you want feedback on, and be clear about what types of comments you’re looking for. Discuss the goals of your portfolio with your reviewers. Consider asking for feedback in the following areas: Does the portfolio make a good impression? Are the project(s) well described? What skills does the reviewer perceive? Is there anything missing? Are there any other projects you should include? Is there a skill you need to add? Does the portfolio reflect your goals? 7.2 Using Feedback Receiving feedback can be difficult, especially when it pertains to a project you have worked hard on, like developing a digital portfolio. Try to remember that the feedback you receive is about the product and that your reviewers want to help you. Ground your decisions about using feedback in the goals you set for your portfolio. Deciding which comments to take action on can also be difficult, particularly if you get conflicting comments. One reviewer might appreciate the template you have chosen while another may find it distracting. Consider the feedback as a whole - do all of your reviewers make similar comments or is one an outlier? And consider the background of the person making the comments. Comments from people in your field might need more weight than your life-long friend who works in a completely different industry, although both perspectives can be valuable. Are the comments constructive and something you can turn into an action? Ask for clarification as needed and have a discussion with your reviewers. You may need to get creative with how you address a given comment. For example, a comment like “the font is too small” might not actually be about the font size, but the readability of the site. This comment might be better addressed by changing the font to one that is easier to read or changing the background color of your web page to increase the contrast between the font and the background. Pay attention to accessibility.

What is the main goal for your portfolio? What should it communicate to potential viewers? Review your CV/resume. What listed project(s) best match your goals? What projects are likely to most excite someone else? How can you integrate various media such as image or video? What platform would you like to use? ACTIVITY 3 breakout rooms - 20 min Introduce yourselves and briefly what you study. Take turns discussing a project and how you’d leverage it in your portfolio to meet your goals. Are there any special considerations/concerns with that match? REPORT OUT: What barriers or concerns did your discussion uncover? Were there any unique situations? Which components of your portfolio are you most concerned about completing? 8.2 Strategies for sensitive data and projects that can’t be shared Sometimes being a good colleague means you may not be able to share every important project you’ve worked on. Whether the data is personally identifiable data (PII), the paper associated with the project is awaiting publication, or the work is a part of a team effort that needs to be shared in another way, you may not be comfortable or able to share a certain project on your personal portfolio. You still may want to share the skills you learned working on these kinds of projects in your portfolio, but you’ll need to find ways to honor the sensitive aspects of the project. Depending on the nature of the project and the reasons you can’t share it in its entirety, here are some potential strategies for including a project of this nature in your portfolio: Describe the project’s goals and status without sharing the code or results Run a similar analysis with open licensed data with a similar structure (or with dummy example data you create for this purpose that has no relation to the original project’s data) to demonstrate your skills Write pseudocode or offer a workflow diagram in place of the code and data Link to the team’s online repository or web pages describing the project For example, maybe you worked on a project where you were responsible for geocoding hundreds of patient addresses. You cannot share this data or the resulting maps because the data is personally identifiable information (PII) and should be kept private. To demonstrate your ability to create and work with geocoded data, you could find a publicly available list of addresses for hospitals and run the same data cleaning, processing, and analysis workflow with that data to post on your portfolio site.
