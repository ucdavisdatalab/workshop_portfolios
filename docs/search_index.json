Typically, these take the form of a website that is styled specifically to highlight the kind of work you want to showcase. A digital portfolio is a tool that you can use in addition to your CV or resume to demonstrate your skills to potential collaborators or employers. Definition - what is a portfolio, and why do you need one? Who you are and shows what you can do. Targeted for a specific purpose or purposes. Common definition: “portfolio as public evidence of your data science skills.” Features your code and documentation, and writing samples to show your ability to communicate effectively about data. Demonstrates how you think about problem-solving. 3.3 Things to Consider This will probably expand into different sections 3.3.1 Plan your Portfolio What is your goal? What story to you want to tell? What impression/feeling/etc. do you want to inspire in the people viewing your portfolio? Which skills and projects do you want to highlight? Which skills and projects help you tell your story to the viewer? Which platform should you use? The platform you chose can serve as another way to highlight a skill you have or an opportunity to develop a skill you want to gain (HTML, Shiny, Wordpress, GitHub Pages, etc.) Style considerations - does your platform have themes that you can use to your advantage? For example, WordPress has some free templates that are specifically geared towards portfolios. How can you visually represent the work your are highlighting? If it’s a mapping project, an image of the map is an obvious choice. If it’s code, think about an image that helps tell the story. Maybe its a visualization (graph or diagram) from the analysis? Maybe it’s a workflow diagram you drew? Links to public repositories like GitHub 3.3.2 Gather Contact Information: There are many things you could include. Choose how you want to engage with others. Some options include: Name Email ORCid or other identifiers Links to public profiles, like your GitHub profile, Google Scholar, Linkedin, or other quasi-social media for work Work-related social media account 3.4 Going Public "],["components-of-data-science-portfolio.html", "4 Components of “Data Science” Portfolio", " 4 Components of “Data Science” Portfolio Resume/CV Explain differences Strategy for CV -&gt; resume Requirements Real Name, affiliation, location OCRid, Google Scholar (if academic) GitHub handle Caveat: Machine readability Examples of good vs bad GitHub Public repo (project) with: code, documentation, narrative, ideally also a “product” (visual, interactive, web app, etc.) Organized; easy to navigate Website GitHub Pages, Wordpress, etc. etc. Easy to navigate, quick load time, best (not all) projects, about me section, contact information Social: Create a LinkedIn profile Point to ICC resources "],["examples.html", "5 Examples", " 5 Examples Research Data Scientist Ryan Peek Arthur?
