Typically, these take the form of a website that is styled specifically to highlight the kind of work you want to showcase. A digital portfolio is a tool that you can use in addition to your CV or resume to communicate your skills to potential collaborators or employers. 1.3 Things to Consider This will probably expand into different sections What is your goal? What story to you want to tell? What impression/feeling/etc. do you want to inspire in the people viewing your portfolio? Which skills and projects do you want to highlight? Which skills and projects help you tell your story to the viewer? Which platform should you use? The platform you chose can serve as another way to highlight a skill you have or an opportunity to develop a skill you want to gain (HTML, Shiny, Wordpress, GitHub Pages, etc.) Style considerations - does your platform have themes that you can use to your advantage? For example, WordPress has some free templates that are specifically geared towards portfolios. How can you visually represent the work your are highlighting? If it’s a mapping project, an image of the map is an obvious choice. If it’s code, think about an image that helps tell the story. Maybe its a visualization (graph or diagram) from the analysis? Maybe it’s a workflow diagram you drew?
