# Setting Your Goals

What is the purpose of your portfolio? 
What jobs are you applying to?
What skills do you want to highlight?
Have you done an “informational interview” and looked at portfolios in your domain?
What technologies are comfortable with already? This is a great excuse to learn new skills!
How will you maintain it? How often will you be updating it?
ACTIVITY 1 (Introspective; paste it into the chat): write down 3-5 personal “goals”
	1-2 examples? Like: I can use R to clean data, write a model, and plot results.
