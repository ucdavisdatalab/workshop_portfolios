# Content

A good portfolio communicates and demonstrates your skills to the viewer. How you do that is something of a creative endeavor. We'll discuss some of the sections and information you could include, but what you include is up to you. You should not try to include everything, but rather pick the information that supports your goal. Every portfolio needs a **Projects** and a **Contact Information** section, but the rest is up to you.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Black and white Noun Project Icon with a woman holdin up architectural plans while a ruler tool floats by her", out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/noun-architect-2909375.png")
```

## Projects
The projects section is the heart of your portfolio and should appear in every portfolio. Here, you will provide a curated collection of projects you want to highlight. 

Project descriptions could be self-contained or they can link out to other websites and code repositories.

Consider including visuals here. If the project involves data visualization, such as a graph, workflow diagram, or map, you might choose that image as your visual. If the project was purely code, you could consider a stock image, just be aware of the image's license and only use images that are open licensed or you have permission to use.

The projects you list should support the goal you have for your portfolio. For example, if my goal is to demonstrate my data visualization skills, I could include code that produces a visualization, but I wouldn't include a script that cleans data and doesn't produce a visualization. If I feel like that cleaning script is valuable in telling my story, maybe I need to redefine my goals for this portfolio. I might want to consider having sections for different kinds of projects.

**IDEA:** You might separate projects into categories based on the type of project.

## Contact Information
This section is also mandatory. You want people to know who you are so they can contact you if they are interested in your work. What information you provide is up to you. How do you decide? Reflect back on your goals. What contact information will help you achieve the goal for your portfolio?

Here are some types of contact information to consider:

* Name - the name you use on job applications 
* Other names you are well-known by (IRC handle, Discord handle)
* Email Address
* [ORCid](https://orcid.org/)
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) (if academic)
* Other academic profiles ([Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/), [Kudos](https://www.growkudos.com/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/))
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) Profile
* Other tech community profiles ([Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/))
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) Profile
* Website
* Work-related social media accounts that you use to represent yourself professionally (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)

```

## About

The about section is the place to describe yourself, your background, and to give your portfolio more context. You might talk about your experience in and out of your current field.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Black and white Noun Project Icon showing a woman giving a talk, pointing at a screen with a graph; in front of her is a computer", out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/noun-keynote-speaker-2909347.png")
```

## Skills

Just like you might have on your CV, you can have a section where you list your skills.

**IDEA:** Consider organizing your portfolio by this list and linking each skill to that section of your website. Some website tools (particularly with content managers like Wordpress) will allow you to tag posts with keywords and then link to a search for that keyword.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Black and white Noun Project Icon showing a woman writing at a typewriter with a self of books nearby", out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/noun-writer-2909379.png")
```

## Publications

Create a list of your publications. Ideally, you can also link to the download site for each paper online to facilitate finding those papers. 

**IDEA:** Consider linking to your contact info page so people can easily to contact you about your papers.
