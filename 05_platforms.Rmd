# Platforms

A platform is the online tool that will house your digital portfolio and make it available to the public through the internet.

There are many platforms available to serve as a home for your digital portfolio. But which platform should you use? Let's take a look at some of the categories and options. Please note that new tools become available quite frequently, so this list is not intended to be comprehensive.

```

## Platform Considerations

First, there are some things to consider.

The platform you chose can serve as another way to highlight a skill you have or an opportunity to develop a skill you want to gain, for example, HTML, Shiny, Wordpress, or GitHub Pages.

Style considerations: does your platform have themes that you can use to your advantage? For example, WordPress has some free templates that are specifically geared towards portfolios. If you plan to use images, does the platform represent images in an engaging way? 

How will you maintain it? How often will you be updating it?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Black and white Noun Project Icon showing a woman points to a slide with html code brackets", out.width="25%"}

```

## Platform Types

### Website Builders

Website Builders are online tools that help you build a website through an online graphical user interface. They typically allow for easy integration of pre-built styles (and changing between styles) and have some kind of content management system to help you keep track of pages and posts. They also usually include a free service tier and can make buying and using a custom domain (website URL) straight forward at minimal yearly cost.

Website builders are good for both novices and pros. Just because you can write HTML and CSS doesn't mean you want to do this on every project. For beginners, this option makes a professional-looking website quickly without a lot of hassle.

Be sure to explore the theme options for your builder of choice. Some themes are free, but others may have a fee to use. Often, you'll find themes that are specifically built for portfolios, but blog themes may also do the job well.

Website Builders include:

* Wix
* Wordpress
* Weebly


| Pros:                  | Cons:              |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Graphical user interface, no coding is necessary | Customizing can be complicated |
| Content manager | |
| Pre-built styles, and easy to change styles | |
| Multiple pages are possible | |
| Looks professional quickly | |



### Build Your Own Website

If you want to demonstrate or develop your skills in web development, you should consider building your own website.

To make you own website, you'll need the following:

**Content**

You can handle content in a couple of ways:

* Hand-coded: edit HTML + CSS (and probably javascript) directly

* Static generator: edit HTML or Markdown directly and generate the website with tools like Jekyll or Sphinx

* Content manager: write content in a graphical user interface with the following options:
	- pre-built: log-in and pick the software you want them to run for you such as ionos, dreamhost, etc.
	- build-your-own: using AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets. etc.



**Hosting Services**

Hosting services provide the physical equipment and maintenance to make your website visible on the internet. Options include:

* Static hosting server: examples include github pages 

* Dynamic hosting service: examples include AWS Lightsail, Digital Ocean Droplets


**Domain** (optional)

A domain is the base URL for your collection of webpages. And example of a domain is `ucdavis.edu`  You can purchase a custom domain to make your website more memorable, but is not necessary. Many hosting service offer domain purchasing and registration as an add-on service.

| Pros:                  | Cons:              |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Control over every aspect of the site | You are often responsible for security and accessibility updates|
| Demonstrate your web skills effectively | |

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Black and white Noun Project Icon showing a woman gesturing to a pie chart with one section pulled away from the others", out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/noun-portfolio-2909344.png")
```

### Short on Time?

The options we will discuss in this section are a way to get started in a relatively short period of time, but you probably want to develop a more creative portfolio that expresses your work in an engaging way when you have more time to spend. 

**LinkedIn Profile**

Your LinkedIn Profile can serve as a portfolio of sorts, especially if you use the "Featured" section to link to projects you want to highlight. This is a good start, but doesn't have the same impact as a well thought out, personal portfolio. 

**IDEA:** Do both, and then add the link for your portfolio to the "Featured" section of your LinkedIn profile.

**GitHub Profile Repository**

Another fairly minimal option for producing a bare-bones profile is to create a GitHub repository with a README file that links to your other repositories with some text for context. This is another nice way to get started, but it might leave an underwhelming impression on potential employers.


| Pros:                  | Cons:              |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Can be used in conjunction with a full portfolio | Less impact than a full portfolio |
| A good starting point to building out a full portfolio | Might reflect negatively on your skills if a full portfolio is called for |
